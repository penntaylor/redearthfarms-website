Title: Visiting

Red Earth Farms welcomes scheduled visitors only. We are open to new members who are aligned with REF’s values and who have the skills and means to take on a challenging adventure in homesteading. Currently there are no plots of land available for lease; however, there are some existing households open to new folks joining them in sub-community.

Because we have limited resources, we will give precedence to visitors who are genuinely interested in joining a community like ours, rather than those who are just passing through. We suggest a stay of at least five days in order for us to really get to know one other.

**We are be open to hosting visitors May through October 2025**

We value affordability and wish for everyone who wants to visit to be able to manage it. We also recognize that it does cost us to host visitors in regards to both the basic expense of food and facilities as well as the non-monetary outlay of time and energy spent on orientation and integration of new people into this lifestyle.

Basic food and facilities cost us approximately $7/day per person, depending on the season. If we pick you up in a vehicle, the trip will cost us 60¢/mile. Visitors should plan to cover their pickup costs. Sometimes ride-share arrangements are available.

We appreciate any and all monetary donations; they help make it possible for us to host visitors who aren’t able to contribute as much financially.

Visitors will be expected to pitch in with our daily tasks, and this certainly helps to compensate for our costs.

If you would like to schedule a visit we ask that you write us a letter covering the points listed below. Please send your letter as plain text in the body of an email (not as an attachment) or by postal mail. ([Relevant addresses]({filename}contact-us.md)) Your letter will be made available for everyone to read before you arrive. If you are planning to visit Red Earth Farms with other people (i.e. your partner, friend, or family), each person should write a separate letter.
